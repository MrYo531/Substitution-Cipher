# Substitution-Cipher
Decrypts text

This program pretty much decrypts text that you give it. This text has to be based on substitution cipher, specifcally base 4.
In the code you can edit the key used to decode the text easily. The format makes it easy to add your own key or edit the existing one.
There are a few issues that cause the program not work perfectly but it majority of the time it's fine.
